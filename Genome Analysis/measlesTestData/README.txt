Measles README file

I am providing the files I used to analyze the measles genome and also my output. If you wish, you may first code your project against this measles genome to see if you get the right output. If you do, it's some easy changes to make the project work for the COVID-19 genome instead.

The .zip file contains the following files:

**** Data Files ****
1. aminoAcidTable.csv (a file holding all information about the amino acids)
2. measlesSequenceRF1.csv (measles genome written into a csv for reading frame 1)
3. measlesSequenceRF2.csv (measles genome written into a csv for reading frame 2)
4. measlesSequenceRF3.csv (measles genome written into a csv for reading frame 3)

**** Results Files ****

1. measlesSequenceRF1_CodonBias.txt
2. measlesSequenceRF1_GeneAnalysis.txt
3. measlesSequenceRF2_CodonBias.txt
4. measlesSequenceRF2_GeneAnalysis.txt
5. measlesSequenceRF3_CodonBias.txt
6. measlesSequenceRF3_GeneAnalysis.txt
